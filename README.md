# Mini Cloudinary Dashboard

A Cloudinary-inspired image management dashboard.

This repository contains the **frontend** (React + Vite) for uploading images, browsing a gallery, previewing transformations, inspecting metadata, and generating signed URLs via a separate backend API.

**Live demo (frontend):** https://cloudinary-dashboard-project.vercel.app/

## 🎥 Video Demo

In this demo, I provide an end-to-end walkthrough of the Mini Cloudinary Dashboard, including gallery synchronization with AWS S3, authenticated image uploads, dynamic image transformations, metadata retrieval, and signed URL generation. The video demonstrates the complete data flow between the React frontend, Express backend, and AWS S3 cloud storage.

## 🧠 Project Overview

This is a mini Cloudinary-style system built to understand how modern image services work end-to-end:

- A backend API handles uploads, transformations, metadata, and signing
- This frontend dashboard provides the UI for interacting with those features
- Images are served through backend routes (not directly from object storage) to enable dynamic transforms

The focus is architecture, data flow, and real-world frontend/backend integration.

## ✨ Features

- Image upload via protected backend endpoint
- On-the-fly transformations via query parameters:
  - Resize (`w`, `h`)
  - Quality (`q`)
  - Format (`jpg`, `png`, `webp`, `avif`)
- Gallery view:
  - Session-based uploads for instant feedback
  - Persistent gallery synced from cloud storage
  - Auto-polling to keep the gallery up-to-date
- Image details:
  - Large preview with live transform controls
  - Metadata inspection
  - Signed URL generation for private access

## 🧱 Tech Stack

- React (Vite)
- Tailwind CSS
- React Router
- Zustand

## 🔌 API Expectations

This frontend expects a backend with routes like:

- `POST /upload` (protected)
- `GET /image/:key` (public, supports transforms via query string)
- `GET /metadata/:key` (protected)
- `GET /sign/:key` (protected)
- `GET /list` (protected)

Some routes are protected using an `x-api-key` header. This is not production-grade auth; it’s meant to demonstrate request protection and client handling patterns.

## 🔗 Integration (Frontend ↔ Backend)

The frontend connects to the **Mini Cloudinary API** using:

- **Base URL**: configured via `VITE_DEFAULT_BASE_URL` (or changed in the UI if your app supports switching)
- **API key**: entered in the dashboard UI and sent as the `x-api-key` header for protected routes

## ⚙️ Configuration

### 🧩 Frontend environment variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```env
VITE_DEFAULT_BASE_URL=https://mini-cloudinary-project.onrender.com
```

`VITE_DEFAULT_BASE_URL` sets the default backend URL on first load.
The API key is entered in the dashboard UI.

## 🚀 Running Locally

## 🗂️ Project Structure

- `src/pages/` – route pages (`Gallery`, `Image`, `Upload`)
- `src/components/` – shared UI components
- `src/store/` – Zustand stores
- `src/api/` – API client helpers

## 📌 Future Improvements

- Real authentication (JWT / OAuth)
- Pagination for large buckets
- Drag-and-drop uploads
- Saved transformation presets
- Better error/loading states
